# Double Pendulum




Add Floor and some walls



sudo ./python3.7m -m ensurepip
sudo ./python3.7m -m pip install scipy
This will update the numpy install, and install scipy. I had touble with existing installations of Blender, but using the standalone directory downloaded fresh from the Blender website worked well.
