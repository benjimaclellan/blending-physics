# Blending Physics

This repo contains some examples of using the open-source 3D animation software Blender, along with Python, to create visually-appealing, yet physically accurate animations of some simple physical systems. 

Creating good visualizations is an incredibly important job of scientists, as it is foundational to clearly explaining our work. However, the figures, videos, and animations which are used to demonstrate experiments and models are often nowhere near as effective as they could be. On the other end, some of these visual stories created for a lay audience lack technical accuracy in exchange for simplicity and visual appeal. This project is a small attempt to merge the two, and use the incredibly powerful combination of Blender and Python -- Blender with its ability to create beautiful animations and renders and with the flexibility and ubiquity of Python for scientific computation. 


### Current demonstrations

Some examples of visualizing physics using the open-source 3D animation software Blender
- Simple Brownian motion
- A double pendulum (seems a requirement)


### Future demonstrations
- Nonlinear optical propagation
- Frustrated magnetic systems
